# Bambora Checkout SDK for Android
The Checkout SDK for Android provides the tools necessary for integrating Bambora Checkout with your Android application. The SDK helps with displaying the Checkout session, and sending out events during the payment flow.

## Installation
Before you are able to use the Bambora Checkout SDK in your project, there is some setup required.

### Gradle dependency
First, add the Checkout SDK to your project's `build.gradle` file.
`implementation com.bambora.checkout:androidsdk:2.0.0`

### Android Manifest
In the AndroidManifest.xml of your app package, you should add the following activity.
```
<activity
  android:name=".ReturnActivity"
  android:exported="true"
  android:launchMode="singleTask">
  <intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />

    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />

    <data
     android:host="bamborasdk"
     android:path="/return"
     android:scheme="bamborademoapp" />
  </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

A deep link implementation is required for processing wallet products.
For correct operation, change the value of the scheme according to your insight. Please leave the host and path values untouched. In the BamboraSDKHelper, also change the APP_SCHEME value to match your set scheme.
You are free to give your `ReturnActivity` a different name, but please make sure it will still intercept the deeplink URL and forward it to the `MainActivity` of your app.

Also ensure that your `MainActivity` - which could be a different name - has the singleTask launch mode.
`android:launchMode="singleTask"`
This is to ensure that the process of redirecting to and from wallet apps is optimized.

## Usage
Processing a payment through the Bambora Checkout SDK requires only a couple of easy steps:
- Initializing the SDK
- Showing the payment screen to your customer
- Listen for events and process the payment result

### Creating a Checkout Session
To initialize the SDK, you need a session token that can be obtained by creating a Checkout session. For details on how to create a Checkout session, have a look at the [Bambora Development Documentation](https://developer.bambora.com/europe/checkout/getting-started/create-payment). 

### Initializing the SDK
Initialize the SDK like so: 
```
val checkout = Bambora.checkout(sessionToken, appScheme, context, customUrl)
```

Parameters:
- `sessionToken`: Token that you received in the previous step, when creating a session
- `appScheme`: The deeplink that you have specified in the URL scheme. How to setup the URL Scheme is mentioned [above](#android-manifest)
- `context`: Activity in which the checkout is initialized. This context will be used to check which wallet apps are installed on the customer's device
- (Optional) `customUrl`: An option to override the default URL to which the SDK will connect

### Displaying the checkout
After having initialized the SDK, the Bambora Checkout UI can be displayed to your customer. To show the payment screen, simply call:
`checkout.show(context)`.

Parameter:
- `context`: Activity context where you want to launch the checkout bottom sheet in

The SDK will render the Checkout web view in a pop up over the current screen. If the customer selects to pay with their wallet payment application, the SDK will make sure to open the corresponding app. The SDK will also handle the redirect back to the configured URL scheme.

### Subscribing to events
The SDK is event-driven. This means that it will sent out events when something notable occurs during the payment flow. To be able to receive these events, you'll have to subscribe to them. This can be done in three different ways.
- Subscribe to **all events**\
  Get notified when any event occurs:
  ```
  checkout.subscribeOnAllEvents()
  ```

- Subscribe to **some events**\
  Get notified when specific events occur. Replace the events in the example below with the ones you need. The possible options are listed [here](#events-overview).
  ```
  checkout.on(listOf(EventType.AUTHORIZE, EventType.CARD_TYPE_RESOLVE))
  ```
  Use the snippet below to subscribe to a single event.
   ```
  checkout.on(EventType.AUTHORIZE)
  ```

- Unsubscribe from **some events**\
  Use the example below to unsubscribe from certain events. Replace the event types with the ones you no longer need to receive.
  ```
  checkout.off(listOf(EventType.AUTHORIZE, EventType.CARD_TYPE_RESOLVE))
  ```
  Use the snippet below to unsubscribe from a specific event.
  ```
  checkout.off(EventType.AUTHORIZE)
  ```

Instead of calling these functions on `checkout` each time, they can easily be applied at the same time on the same instance of the Checkout.
```
Bambora.checkout(sessionToken, appScheme, context, customUrl).apply {
    subscribeOnAllEvents()
    // any other functions you want to call on the Checkout instance
}
```

### Receiving events
To intercept the events that you have subscribed to, you need to assign an instance of `CheckoutEventReceiver` to your checkout's property `checkoutEventReceiver`. `CheckoutEventReceiver` needs to override the `onEventDispatched(event: Event)` function like below.
```
checkout.checkoutEventReceiver = object : CheckoutEventReceiver {
    override fun onEventDispatched(event: Event) {
        if (event is Event.Authorize) {
            // do something when an Authorize event was intercepted
        } else {
            // do something when any other event was intercepted
        }
    }
}
```

### Events overview
The following events can be listened to.
| Event                  | Trigger                                                                                                       | Data description |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------                                                 |
| Authorize              | Sent when a payment has been authorized                                                                       | Contains payment data, such as `txnId` and `orderId`                         |
| CheckoutViewClose      | Sent when the payment screen has been closed                                                                  | Contains no data                                                             |
| PaymentTypeSelection   | Sent when a payment type has been selected                                                                    | Contains the payment type, such as `paymentcard` or `mobilepay`              |
| CardTypeResolve        | Sent whenever enough digits of the payment card number have been entered to determine the payment card type   | Contains payment card type data, such as `id` and `fee`                      |
| ErrorEvent             | Sent when an error occurs                                                                                     | Contains a BamboraException type, such as `LoadSessionException` or `GenericException`  |

More information about the different types of Events and their data, can be found at the [Bambora Development Documentation](https://developer.bambora.com/europe/sdk/web-sdk/advanced-usage). 

### Closing the SDK
The Checkout SDK is closed automatically when a payment was authorized and therefore completed. In all other scenarios, the SDK can be closed by calling `Bambora.close()`. This is required before the SDK can be reinitialized for a new payment.

Note that, if the user is still completing the payment, this may cause the payment to fail.

When the SDK is closed, a few things happen:
- The Activity showing the Checkout web view is closed, and thus the web view is also dismissed immediately
- Resources of the SDK, such as Checkout, are cleaned up
- A new payment session can now be instantiated

## Demo App
The Demo App shows how you can use the Bambora Checkout SDK in your own app. It shows how to implement the following features:
- Initialize a session with Bambora's default production URL
- See the details of a payment after it was completed
- Listen and respond to events
- Configure a deeplink URL
